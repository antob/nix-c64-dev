# nix-c64-dev

Some C64 development tools in a Nix flake

## Provided tools

* exomizer 3.0.2
* kickassembler 5.19
* c64debugger 0.64.58.2
* xa 2.3.11
* vice 3.5

## Additional notes

The vice derivation ideally should be upstreamed, but the build is a bit
sketchy and heavily modified to work in a flakes environment.
